### Project management

- ðŸ“–Â [The Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)Â by Frederick Brooks is a classical book about software project management.
    - Now I do not think software managers have less inherent courage and firmness than chefs, nor than other engineering managers. But false scheduling to match the patron's desired date is much more common in our discipline than elsewhere in engineering.
    - The boss must first distinguish between action information and status information. He must discipline himself not to act on problems his managers can solve.
- Jason Yip,Â [It's Not Just Standing Up: Patterns for Daily Standup Meetings](http://martinfowler.com/articles/itsNotJustStandingUp.html): standup are a pretty controversial topics. This article on Martin Fowler's blog provides a good list of patterns and anti-patterns to ensure they're a good productive use of everybody's time.

    - Deadlines set wrong expectations for what's good
    - People are going to cut corners if you put them to tough deadlines.
    - No one is going to experiment with new ways of doing things if you fetishize finishing under deadlines. We'd still be doing MVC in frontend apps if someone at Facebook didn't miss a deadline.
    - Have deadlines, but fuzzy. How fuzzy should be decided by your goals. If missing a deadline could potentially lose you a million dollars, the fuzziness factor for that should be zero.

    - Having a regular, no-BS update on where the team really is
    - Dependency and Risk Management in a pragmatic way
    - Celebrate after completion!

    - You must provide frameworks and constraints
    - Project planning has an inflection point.

> The ultimate inspiration is the deadline. â€” Nolan Bushnell

> You must create hilariously aggressive deadlines for yourself, otherwise, youâ€™ll get swept away in unnecessary details that arenâ€™t actually mission-critical. If youâ€™re thinking about color schemes and button widths, your timeline is too long. â€“ Tara Viswanathan
